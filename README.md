# Babyname

This app helps you to find names for babies from 7k+ names.

## PS
This is my very first Flutter App made completely by me. <br>
Yes, I know code is too spaghetti but for the first project it's fine. <br>
The structure of the project is really very basic because of its small complexity. <br>
For the database, I used <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite">sqflite</a> package from pub.dev <br>
